# Example Notebooks for Raspberry Pi with Respeaker 4-mic microphone array

This repository contains some code samples to demonstrate voice processing on a Raspberry PI with a Respeaker microphone array.

The processing modules are provided by the [VOICEN](https://voicen.io/) project 
(see [github.com/voice-engine/voice-engine](https://github.com/voice-engine/voice-engine))

## DOA
Demonstrate direction of arrival (DOA) detection using the GCC_PHAT algorithm. 

## pixel_ring
Demonstrate how to give feedback using the pixel ring.

## alexa_voice_service
Put together beam forming, noise reduction, KWS, DOA and Alexa Voice Service to create a smart assistant using the raspi.
